\chapter{Conceptual mockups}
\label{app:conceptual-mockups}

This appendix displays the Figma mockups devised early on in the research, starting by the mobile application and then with the desktop editor, including a \gls{3D} version of its development mode (an idea which was later abandoned, as explained in section~\ref{ssec:soundscape-editor-overview}), reminiscent of Ferreira's~\cite{ferreira2021creating} Immerscape.

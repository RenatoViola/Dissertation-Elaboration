I will first thank my advisors for their guidance and supervision of this dissertation. Not to forget professor João Lourenço for the \novathesis\ template in which it was written.

I must also express my sincere appreciation to the Raquel \& Martin Sain Foundation for their invaluable cooperation from the preliminary phase of the study to its conclusion, from which I am particularly grateful to Cláudia Pires and Ana Inês Soares for their constructive feedback and making themselves available for both phases of the research.

My honest gratitude goes to all the BVI participants who took the time to validate the proposed mobile application, as well as the normovisual participants who evaluated the desktop editor.

Above all, I am immensely thankful to my family and friends for their support and encouragement throughout this stage in my life. I could not do what I do if it weren't for their love and understanding.

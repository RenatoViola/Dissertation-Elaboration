In their mission as inclusive spaces of cultural participation and celebration, museums have taken considerable strides in overcoming their historical reliance on sight to adequately accommodate the needs of the blind and visually impaired (BVI). 

However, accessibility tends to be an afterthought rather than a priority, and most exhibitions have mainly remained inaccessible to a BVI audience. Meritable as they are, the most common accessibility methods often fail to balance exposure to information and proper artwork engagement, if even available. Finding their independence, mobility, and interpretative access conditioned, low-vision people rarely attend these institutions despite enjoying and expressing the desire to experience visual art.

In this dissertation, we propose a remote and interactive approach to BVI-accessible visual art representation, in which spatial audio provides a feeling of immersion and simulates exploration. The devised system is symbiotically divided, with each part catering to a unique audience.

The system includes a 3D soundscape editor for Windows, in which museum curators without prior sound design expertise may quickly develop immersive virtual auditory scenes representative of specific artworks. The generated environments are interactive via a mobile soundscape player, where BVI users autonomously explore their composition through assisted thumbstick movement, directional audio cues, and a vicinity scanning tool. The experience offers room for customization, incorporating controls for sensory load regulation.

Ultimately, our proposal aims to fulfill BVI visitors' informational and aesthetic needs regarding visual art access, promoting their independence while remaining cost-effective.
